# AlexaPi
Alexa Voice Service on the Raspberry Pi used for Home Automation
Thie repository contains the Python Code used to control LED lights placed in two different rooms(as assumed) using Alexa integrated on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+
The SDK for Alexa Voice Service with detailed step-by-step installation instructions can be found in the link provided below.

I am not a contributing member to the SDK and do not claim to be either nor do I claim any ownership of that repository.
I am providing the link as is just for information which can otherwise found by googling 'Alexa AVS SDK github'.


You will have to run the code provided side-by-side with the SDK on a separate terminal window for it to work.


Thank You,
